description: "Deep reflection on the last implementation: rule adherence, verification, and refactoring opportunities"

# ultrathink

Take time to deeply reflect and reason about your most recent implementation work. Before reaching any conclusions, thoroughly analyze:

## 1. Rule Adherence
- Review ALL applicable workspace rules and coding standards
- Did you follow them strictly, or did you take shortcuts?
- Were there any rules you overlooked or misinterpreted?
- Did you apply the rules consistently throughout the implementation?

## 2. Implementation Completeness
- Did you implement EVERYTHING that was planned or requested?
- Review the original task/plan: are all requirements met?
- Are there any TODOs, pending items, or incomplete features?
- Did you skip any steps thinking they were optional?
- Is the implementation fully functional end-to-end?

## 3. Verification & Testing
- Did you verify that your implementation actually works?
- What testing did you perform (unit tests, integration tests, manual verification)?
- Are there edge cases you didn't test?
- Did you verify error handling and edge conditions?

## 4. Refactoring Opportunities
- Looking at the code with fresh eyes, what could be improved?
- Are there patterns in the project's architecture you should have followed better?
- Is there duplicated logic that could be extracted?
- Are there naming, structure, or organization improvements possible?

**Important**: 
- Spend significant time reasoning through each point
- Be critical and honest about your work
- Consider the specific context and patterns of this codebase

After your reflection, present your findings concisely to the user:
- What you did well
- What rules/patterns you may have violated or missed
- What refactoring opportunities exist

**DO NOT implement any changes yet** - just share your reflections.
