# D&D 3.5 Spellcasting Systems

This document catalogs the mechanically distinct spellcasting systems found in D&D 3.5, based on research into official classes and their unique mechanics.

## 1. Prepared/Vancian Casting
**Classes**: Wizard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger (partial), Paladin (partial)

**Mechanics**:
- Must prepare specific spells in advance (typically after rest)
- Each spell slot holds a specific prepared spell
- Casting consumes the prepared spell slot
- Different classes have different spell lists and preparation restrictions
- Specialist wizards get bonus spells but restricted schools

**Resource Management**: Daily spell slots per level, must be pre-allocated to specific spells

## 2. Spontaneous Casting
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Bard, Favored Soul, Dread Necromancer (partial)

**Mechanics**:
- Know a limited number of spells permanently
- Can cast any known spell using available spell slots
- More flexible casting but fewer total spells known
- Some classes (like Dread Necromancer) have hybrid mechanics

**Resource Management**: Daily spell slots per level, flexible casting from known spells

## 3. Spell-like Abilities / Inspiration-based
**Classes**: Factotum

**Mechanics**:
- Uses "Inspiration Points" that refresh each encounter (not daily)
- "Arcane Dilettante" provides spell-like abilities mimicking wizard/sorcerer spells
- Can apply metamagic to spell-like abilities
- Completely different resource cycle from traditional casting

**Resource Management**: Inspiration points per encounter, not daily slots

## 4. At-will/Unlimited Casting
**Classes**: Warlock

**Mechanics**:
- Unlimited use of basic abilities (eldritch blast)
- Limited number of "invocations" (magical abilities)
- Some invocations are at-will, others have limited uses
- No traditional spell slots

**Resource Management**: Mix of at-will and limited-use abilities

## 5. Power Point System
**Classes**: Psion, Wilder, Psychic Warrior

**Mechanics**:
- Uses power points instead of spell slots
- Can spend variable points to augment powers
- More flexible resource allocation
- Different from traditional spellcasting (technically "psionics")

**Resource Management**: Power point pool, flexible spending

## 6. Hybrid/Unique Systems

### Binder
- Gains abilities from binding with "vestiges" (extraplanar entities)
- Abilities change based on which vestiges are bound
- Limited daily bindings

### Shadowcaster
- Uses "mysteries" instead of spells
- Shadow-based magic system
- Different progression and mechanics

### Truenamer
- Uses "utterances" - specific magical words
- Unique difficulty and failure mechanics
- Very different from traditional spellcasting

### Warmage
- Spontaneous caster focused on combat spells
- Limited spell selection but specialized

## Implementation Considerations

### Core Differences to Account For:
1. **Resource Type**: Spell slots vs. points vs. at-will vs. encounter-based
2. **Preparation**: Pre-selected spells vs. flexible casting
3. **Refresh Cycle**: Daily vs. encounter vs. at-will
4. **Spell Access**: Known spells vs. spell lists vs. fixed abilities
5. **Augmentation**: Metamagic vs. power point spending vs. fixed effects

### Commonalities:
- Most systems have some form of level-based progression
- Most interact with ability scores for bonuses
- Most have some form of resource limitation
- Many can be enhanced through feats or items

## Research Sources
- D&D 3.5 SRD class listings (66 total classes identified)
- Giant in the Playground optimization forums
- Class-specific handbooks and guides
