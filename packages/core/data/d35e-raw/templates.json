        "value": "No matter its form, a half-fiend is always hideous to behold, having dark scales, horns, glowing red eyes, bat wings, a fetid odor, or some other obvious sign that it is tainted with evil. Creating a Half-Fiend \"Half-fiend\" is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or more and non-good alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged. Half-fiends are normally native outsiders. Speed: A half-fiend has bat wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the creature can fly at the base creature's base land speed (average maneuverability). Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any natural armor bonus the base creature has). Attack: A half-fiend has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-fiend retains this ability. A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses a claw when making an attack action. When it has a weapon, it usually uses the weapon instead. Full Attack: A half-fiend fighting without weapons uses both claws and its bite when making a full attack. If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack and its bite as a natural secondary attack. If it has a hand free, it uses a claw as an additional natural secondary attack. Damage: Half-fiends have bite and claw attacks. If the base creature does not have these attack forms, use the damage values in the table below. Otherwise, use the values below or the base creature's damage values, whichever are greater. Size Bite Damage Claw Damage Fine 1 - Diminutive 1d2 1 Tiny 1d3 1d2 Small 1d4 1d3 Medium 1d6 1d4 Large 1d8 1d6 Huge 2d6 1d8 Gargantuan 3d6 2d6 Colossal 4d6 3d6 Special Attacks: A half-fiend retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains the following special attack. Smite Good (Su) : Once per day the creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against a good foe. Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or higher has spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The abilities are cumulative. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the creature's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based. Special Qualities: A half-fiend has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus the following special qualities. Darkvision out to 60 feet. Immunity to poison. Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10. Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more). A half-fiend's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Spell resistance equal to creature's HD + 10 (maximum 35). Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +4, Con +2, Int +4, Cha +2. Skills: A half-fiend gains skill points as an outsider and has skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier) x (HD + 3). Do not include Hit Dice from class levels in this calculation-the half-fiend gains outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal amount of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from the base creature's list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class. Challenge Rating: HD 4 or less, as base creature +1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3. Alignment: Always evil (any). Level Adjustment: +4.",

Sometimes they have wings. Creating a Half-Dragon \"Half-dragon\" is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type* : The creature's type changes to dragon. Size is unchanged. Do not recalculate base attack bonus or saves. Hit Dice: Increase base creature's racial HD by one die size, to a maximum of d12. Do not increase class HD. Speed: A half-dragon that is Large or larger has wings and can fly at twice its base land speed (maximum 120 ft.) with average maneuverability. A half-dragon that is Medium or smaller does not have wings. Armor Class* : Natural armor improves by +4. Attack: A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack, and the claws are the primary natural weapon. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-dragon retains this ability.

        "value": "This template requires you do rebuild a creature/character. Replace Racial HD with Undead type and reroll hp. Features denoted with * and underlined are set up automatically. Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, mindless automatons that obey the orders of their evil masters. A skeleton is seldom garbed in anything more than the rotting remnants of any clothing or armor it was wearing when slain. A skeleton does only what it is ordered to do. It can draw no conclusions of its own and takes no initiative. Because of this limitation, its instructions must always be simple. A skeleton attacks until destroyed. Creating a Skeleton \"Skeleton\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from class levels (to a minimum of 1) and raise remaining Hit Dice to d12s. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell. Speed: Winged skeletons can't use their wings to fly. If the base creature flew magically, so can the skeleton. Armor Class: Natural armor bonus changes to a number based on the skeleton's size: Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium or Large +2 Huge +3 Gargantuan +6 Colossal +10 Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks that can't work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A skeleton's base attack bonus is equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice. Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton's size. (If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it's better.) Diminutive or Fine 1 Tiny 1d2 Small 1d3 Medium 1d4 Large 1d6 Huge 1d8 Gargantuan 2d6 Colossal 2d8 Special Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Special Qualities: A skeleton loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A skeleton gains the following special qualities. Immunity to Cold (Ex)*: Skeletons are not affected by cold. Damage Reduction 5/Bludgeoning (Ex)*: Skeletons lack flesh or internal organs. Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. Abilities*: A skeleton's Dexterity increases by +2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1. Skills: A skeleton has no skills. Feats: A skeleton loses all feats of the base creature and gains .Improved Initiative Environment: Any, usually same as base creature. Organization: Any. Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows: Hit Dice Challenge Rating Hit Dice Challenge Rating 1/2 1/6 1 1/3 2-3 1 4-5 2 6-7 3 8-9 4 10-11 5 12-14 6 15-17 7 18-20 8 Treasure: None. Alignment: Always neutral evil. Advancement: As base creature (or - if the base creature advances by character class). Level Adjustment: -.",

        "value": "Fiendish creatures dwell on the lower planes, the realms of evil, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more fearsome in appearance than their earthly counterparts. Creating a Fiendish Creature \"Fiendish\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin of nongood alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A fiendish creature uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes. Size and Type: Animals or vermin with this template become magical beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Fiendish creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype. Special Attacks: A fiendish creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following special attack. Smite Good (Su) : Once per day the creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum of +20) against a good foe. Special Qualities: A fiendish creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following. Darkvision out to 60 feet. Damage reduction (see the table below). Resistance to cold and fire (see the table below). Spell resistance equal to the creature's HD + 5 (maximum 25). Hit Dice Resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity Damage Reduction 1-3 5 - 4-7 5 5/magic 8-11 10 5/magic 12 or more 10 10/magic If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value. If a fiendish creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Abilities: Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. Environment: Any evil-aligned plane. Challenge Rating: HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2. Alignment: Always evil (any). Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +2.",

        "value": "No matter the form, half-celestials are always comely and delightful to the senses, having golden skin, sparkling eyes, angelic wings, or some other sign of their higher nature. Creating A Half-Celestial \"Half-celestial\" is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher and nonevil alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-celestial uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged. Half-celestials are normally native outsiders. Speed: A half-celestial has feathered wings and can fly at twice the base creature's base land speed (good maneuverability). If the base creature has a fly speed, use that instead. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1 (this stacks with any natural armor bonus the base creature has). Special Attacks: A half-celestial retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following special abilities. Daylight (Su) : Half-celestials can use a daylight effect (as the spell) at will. Smite Evil (Su) : Once per day a half-celestial can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe. Spell-Like Abilities: A half-celestial with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or higher has two or more spell-like abilities, depending on its Hit Dice, as indicated on the table below. The abilities are cumulative Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the creature's HD, and the save DC is Charisma-based. Special Qualities: A half-celestial has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus the following special qualities. Darkvision out to 60 feet. Immunity to disease. Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10. Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more). A half-celestial's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Spell resistance equal to creature's HD + 10 (maximum 35). +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison. Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. Skills: A half-celestial gains skill points as an outsider and has skill points equal to (8 + Int modifier) x (HD +3). Do not include Hit Dice from class levels in this calculation-the half-celestial gains outsider skill points only for its racial Hit Dice, and gains the normal amount of skill points for its class levels. Treat skills from the base creature's list as class skills, and other skills as cross-class. Challenge Rating: HD 5 or less, as base creature +1; HD 6 to 10, as base creature +2; HD 11 or more, as base creature +3. Alignment: Always good (any). Level Adjustment: Same as base creature +4.",

        "value": "Celestial creatures dwell on the upper planes, the realms of good, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more regal and more beautiful than their earthly counterparts. Celestial creatures often come in metallic colors (usually silver, gold, or platinum). They can be mistaken for half-celestials, more powerful creatures that are created when a celestial mates with a non-celestial creature. Creating A Celestial Creature \"Celestial\" is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin of good or neutral alignment (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A celestial creature uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes. Size and Type: Animals or vermin with this template become magical beasts, but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Celestial creatures encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype. Special Attacks: A celestial creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack. Smite Evil (Su) : Once per day a celestial creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against an evil foe. Special Qualities: A celestial creature retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following qualities. Darkvision out to 60 feet. Damage reduction (see the table below). Resistance to acid, cold, and electricity (see the table below). Spell resistance equal to HD + 5 (maximum 25). Hit Dice Resistance to Acid, Cold, Electricity Damage Reduction 1-3 5 - 4-7 5 5/magic 8-11 10 5/magic 12 or more 10 10/magic If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value. If a celestial creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Abilities: Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3. Environment: Any good-aligned plane. Challenge Rating: HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2. Alignment: Always good (any). Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +2.",

        "value": "This template requires you do rebuild a creature/character. Replace HD value in classes/racial HD and reroll hp. Features denoted with * and underlined are set up automatically. A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer but sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who has used its magical powers to unnaturally extend its life. A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones. Its eyes have long ago been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on in the empty sockets. Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life. Creating a Lich \"Lich\" is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required phylactery; see The Lich's Phylactery, below. A lich has all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged. Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s. Armor Class*: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better. Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use once per round. If the base creature can use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it desires. Full Attack: A lich fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a touch as a natural secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that attack (either a free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack). Damage: A lich without natural weapons has a touch attack that uses negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier) halves the damage. A lich with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry, as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra damage on one natural weapon attack. Special Attacks: A lich retains all the base creature's special attacks and gains those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich's HD + lich's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Fear Aura (Su)*: Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell from a sorcerer of the lich's level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. Paralyzing Touch (Su)* : Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive. Spells: A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive. Special Qualities: A lich retains all the base creature's special qualities and gains those described below. Turn Resistance (Ex): A lich has +4 turn resistance. Damage Reduction (Su)* : A lich's undead body is tough, giving the creature damage reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Immunities (Ex): Liches have immunity to cold* , electricity* , polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks. Abilities* : Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score. Skills* : Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature. Organization: Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2-4 vampires and 5-8 vampire spawn). Challenge Rating* : Same as the base creature + 2. Treasure: Standard coins; double goods; double items. Alignment: Any evil. Advancement: By character class. Level Adjustment* : Same as the base creature +4.",

        "value": "This template requires you do rebuild a creature/character. Replace Racial HD with Undead type and reroll hp. Features denoted with * and underlined are set up automatically. Zombies are corpses reanimated through dark and sinister magic. Because of their utter lack of intelligence, the instructions given to a newly created zombie must be very simple. Creating a Zombie \"Zombie\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtypes except alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice from class levels (to a minimum of 1), double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12s. If the base creature has more than 10 Hit Dice (not counting those gained with experience), it can't be made into a zombie with the animate dead spell. Speed: If the base creature can fly, its maneuverability rating drops to clumsy. Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by a number based on the zombie's size: Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium +2 Large +3 Huge +4 Gargantuan +7 Colossal +11 Base Attack: A zombie has a base attack bonus equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice. Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A zombie also gains a slam attack. Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the zombie's size. (Use the base creature's slam damage if it's better.) Fine 1 Diminutive 1d2 Tiny 1d3 Small 1d4 Medium 1d6 Large 1d8 Huge 2d6 Gargantuan 2d8 Colossal 4d6 Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A zombie gains the following special quality. Damage Reduction 5/Slashing (Ex)* : Zombies are lumbering masses of flesh. Single Actions Only (Ex) : Zombies have poor reflexes and can perform only a single move action or attack action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round, but only if it attempts a charge. Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2. Abilities*: A zombie's Strength increases by +2, its Dexterity decreases by 2, it has no Constitution or Intelligence score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma changes to 1. Skills: A zombie has no skills. Feats: A zombie loses all feats of the base creature and gains Toughness. Environment: Any land and underground. Organization: Any. Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows: Hit Dice Challenge Rating Hit Dice Challenge Rating 1/2 1/8 1 1/4 2 1/2 4 1 6 2 8-10 3 12-14 4 15-16 5 18-20 6 Treasure: None. Alignment: Always neutral evil. Advancement: As base creature, but double Hit Dice (maximum 20), or - if the base creature advances by character class. Level Adjustment: -.",

        "value": "This template requires you do rebuild a creature/character. Replace HD value in classes/racial HD and reroll hp. Features denoted with * and underlined are set up automatically. Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves. Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. Vampires speak any languages they knew in life. Creating a Vampire \"Vampire\" is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A vampire uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented humanoid or monstrous humanoid). Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged. Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in running water (see below). Armor Class*: The base creature's natural armor bonus improves by +6. Attack: A vampire retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if it didn't already have one. If the base creature can use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon, as it desires. Full Attack: A vampire fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural secondary attack. Damage: Vampires have slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value from the table below according to the vampire's size. Creatures that have other kinds of natural weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropriate value from the table below, whichever is better. Size Damage Fine 1 Diminutive 1d2 Tiny 1d3 Small 1d4 Medium 1d6 Large 1d8 Huge 2d6 Gargantuan 2d8 Colossal 4d6 Special Attacks: A vampire retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains those described below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless noted otherwise. Blood Drain (Ex)* : A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. Children of the Night (Su)* : Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour. Dominate (Su)*: A vampire can crush an opponent's will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampire's influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days after burial. If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again. Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampire's slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round. Special Qualities: A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below. Alternate Form (Su)*: A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.) Damage Reduction (Su)*: A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Fast Healing (Ex): A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Gaseous Form (Su)*: As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Resistances (Ex)*: A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10. Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a Spider Climb spell. Turn Resistance (Ex): A vampire has +4 turn resistance. Abilities*: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score. Skills*: Vampires have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature. Feats: Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and doesn't already have these feats. Environment: Any, usually same as base creature. Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (3-5), or troupe (1-2 plus 2-5 vampire spawn) Challenge Rating*: Same as the base creature +2. Treasure: Double standard. Alignment: Always evil (any). Advancement: By character class. Level Adjustment*: Same as the base creature +8.",

      "description": {
        "value": "This template requires you do rebuild a creature/character. Replace HD value in classes/racial HD and reroll hp. Features denoted with * and underlined are set up automatically. Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered. Creating a Ghost \"Ghost\" is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6. A ghost uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged. Hit Dice: All current and future Hit Dice become d12s. Speed: Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability. Armor Class: Natural armor is the same as the base creature's but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher. Attack: A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal. Full Attack: A ghost retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal. Damage: Against ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature's damage values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below). Special Attacks: A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other special attacks as described below. The save DC against a special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Corrupting Gaze (Su)* : A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Corrupting Touch (Su)* : A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only. Draining Touch (Su)* : A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only. Frightful Moan (Su)* : A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours. Horrific Appearance (Su)* : Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific appearance for 24 hours. Malevolence (Su)* : Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 + ghost's Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target's body. Manifestation (Su) : Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost's touch spells don't work on nonethereal targets. A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes. Telekinesis (Su)* : A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again. Special Qualities : A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below. Rejuvenation (Su) : In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The \"destroyed\" spirit will often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost's HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research. Turn Resistance (Ex) : A ghost has +4 turn resistance. Abilities* : Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4. Skills* : Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature. Environment: Any, often as base creature. Organization: Solitary, gang (2-4), or mob (7-12). Challenge Rating*: Same as the base creature +2. Treasure: None. Alignment: Any. Level Adjustment* : Same as the base creature +5.",

Monsters who naturally possess psionic ability are not found as phrenic creatures. Phrenic creatures are freaks among their kind, otherwise normal creatures whose minds are more powerful than those of their fellows. Similarly, creatures who advance by character class are usually not phrenic creatures-they simply take levels in a psionic class to hone their mental powers. Creating a Phrenic Creature \"Phrenic\" is an inherited template that can be added to any nonmindless creature that does not already have the psionic subtype (referred to hereafter as the \"base creature\"). A phrenic creature uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Size and Type: The creature's type does not change, unless it is an animal (in which case it becomes a magical beast [augmented animal]). It gains the psionic subtype. Psi-Like Abilities (Sp): A phrenic creature possesses the psi-like abilities indicated below, depending on its Hit Dice. The abilities are cumulative. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Manifester level is equal to the creature's HD. The save DCs for a phrenic creature's psi-like abilities are Charisma-based. Special Qualities: A phrenic creature has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus the following special qualities. Naturally Psionic: A phrenic creature gains 1 bonus power point. Power Resistance (Ex): A phrenic creature has power resistance equal to its Hit Dice +10. Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2 (if Int is 3 or greater), Wis +2, Cha +4. Feats: A phrenic creature can take psionic feats, if it meets the prerequisites for such feats. Challenge Rating: Up to 5 HD, same as base creature +1; 6-10 HD, same as base creature +2; 11+ HD, same as base creature +3. Level Adjustment: Same as base creature +2.",
