    "description": "Annulus: This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the Annulus is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes. The Annulus is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item. The Annulus has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact's powers immediately flood the wielder's mind. The wielder can access all powers of the Annulus at manifester level 20th. The Annulus generates a continuous catapsi effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected). The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage. Once per day, the wielder can trigger ultrablast as a standard action. Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to psionic dimensional anchor that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius. The primary power of the Annulus , however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the Annulus . Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target-regardless of any protection it may possess-disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust. It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the Annulus to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.",

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail.

    "description": "Book of Infinite Spells: This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells. Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is. Condition Chance of Page Turning Caster employing a spell usable by own class and level 10% Caster employing a spell not usable by own class and level 20% Nonspellcaster employing divine spell 25% Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell 30% Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.

Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection , banishment , elemental swarm , gate , greater planar ally , greater planar binding , plane shift , and soul bind . Each is usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks. d% Catastrophe 01-25 Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader. 26-50 Fiendish Vengeance: A Gate opens and 1d3+1 balor demons, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders immediately step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex . 51-75 Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as trap the soul ; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment ). 76-100 Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell.

    "name": "Crawling Tattoos",
    "description": "Crawling Tattoos: Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the body adjustment power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer. The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated. The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the wearer's manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates. A crawling tattoo must enter the target's square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target's threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo's touch attack to succeed if he or she desires. Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible. Market Price: The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it. Power Level Market Price 1st 50 gp 2nd 300 gp 3rd 750 gp Crawling tattoo of concussion : This crawling tattoo delivers a concussion effect, dealing 1d6 points of damage to a creature hit by its touch attack.

    "description": "Crystal Anchor: A crystal anchor is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation. A crystal anchor is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect similar to brain lock , except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the crystal anchor into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and reused at a later time. When a crystal anchor successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field. A crystal anchor can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts. An anchor's owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One crystal anchor can ensnare multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple crystal anchors can share overlapping fields. Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer. A crystal anchor has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.

This liquid can't be saved or stored in any way. The Talisman is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast remove blindness/deafness , remove curse , and remove disease at will. Furthermore, if the Talisman is placed within the Cup and the Cup filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir of resurrection (as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the Cup or Talisman is struck with a holy word (if evil) or dictum (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).",

When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table.

    "description": "Deck of Many Things: A deck of many things (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. Exception: If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Deck of Many Things Plaque Tarot Card Playing Card Summary of Effect Balance XI. Justice Two of spades Change alignment instantly. Comet Two of swords Two of diamonds Defeat the next monster you meet to gain one level. Donjon Four of swords Ace of spades You are imprisoned . Euryale Ten of swords Queen of spades -1 penalty on all saving throws henceforth. The Fates Three of cups Ace of hearts Avoid any situation you choose . . . once. Flames XV. The Devil Queen of clubs Enmity between you and an outsider. Fool 0. The Fool Joker (with trademark) Lose 10,000 experience points and you must draw again. Gem Seven of cups Two of hearts Gain your choice of twenty-five pieces of jewelry or fifty gems. Idiot Two of pentacles Two of clubs Lose Intelligence (permanent drain). You may draw again. Jester XII. The Hanged Man Joker (without trademark) Gain 10,000 XP or two more draws from the deck. Key V. The Hierophant Queen of hearts Gain a major magic weapon. Knight Page of swords Jack of hearts Gain the service of a 4th-level fighter. Moon XVIII. The Moon Queen of diamonds You are granted 1d4 wishes. Rogue Five of swords Jack of spades One of your friends turns against you. Ruin XVI. The Tower King of spades Immediately lose all wealth and real property. Skull XIII. Death Jack of clubs Defeat dread wraith or be forever destroyed. Star XVII. The Star Jack of diamonds Immediately gain a +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. Sun XIX. The Sun King of diamonds Gain beneficial medium wondrous item and 50,000 XP. Talons Queen of pentacles Ace of clubs All magic items you possess disappear permanently. Throne Four of staves King of hearts Gain a +6 bonus on Diplomacy checks plus a small keep. Vizier IX. The Hermit Ace of diamonds Know the answer to your next dilemma. The Void Eight of swords King of clubs Body functions, but soul is trapped elsewhere. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment- either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. Moon: This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone-if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle . Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. Strong (all schools); CL 20th.",

    "name": "Figurines of Wondrous Power",
    "description": "Figurines of Wondrous Power: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 10,000 gp. Ebony Fly: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 10,000 gp. Golden Lions: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 16,500 gp. Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function: The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used. The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance , the other as a +5 longsword ). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 21,000 gp. Marble Elephant: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 17,000 gp. Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight , plane shift , and ethereal jaunt . The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts , its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects , etherealness , fly , plane shift ; Price 28,500 gp. Onyx Dog: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility . An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 15,500 gp. Serpentine Owl: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its Intelligence.) Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects ; Price 9,100 gp. Silver Raven: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.

Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) Ruby: Wall of fire Fire opal: fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half ) Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer.

Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time. Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.)

    "description": "Iron Flask: These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. The command word can be given only once per day. If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile.

One pot of Marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. Only normal, inanimate objects can be created.

It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner. If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

(Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester's own power.) A ring of epic psionics V increases the wearer's daily power points by 43 points, a ring of epic psionics VI grants 63 power points, a ring of epic psionics VII grants 87 power points, a ring of epic psionics VIII grants 115 points, and a ring of epic psionics IX grants 147 power points.

The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.

During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. Dancing lights (once per hour) Light (twice per night) Ball lightning (special, once per night) Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning , releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights , and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the Dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. Number of Balls Damage per Ball 4 lightning balls 1d6 points of damage each 3 lightning balls 2d6 points of damage each 2 lightning balls 3d6 points of damage each 1 lightning ball 4d6 points of damage Once the Ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.) The second special function produces three Shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball ) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. Faerie fire (twice per day) Spark shower (special, once per day) The Spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.

She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time. A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.

    "description": "Sphere of Annihilation: A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation , the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest. Should a gate spell be cast upon a sphere of annihilation , there is a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51-85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86-100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a rod of cancellation touches a sphere of annihilation , they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of damage. Dispel magic and mage's disjunction have no effect on a sphere. See also talisman of the sphere (below). Strong transmutation; CL 20th.",

    "description": "Staff of the Magi: A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following powers do not use charges: Detect magic Enlarge person ( Fortitude DC 15 negates) Hold portal Light Mage armor Mage hand The following powers drain 1 charge per usage: Dispel magic Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) ice storm Invisibility Knock Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) Passwall Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates) Wall of fire Web These powers drain 2 charges per usage: Monster summoning IX Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates) Telekinesis (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates) A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.) Retributive Strike: A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power are capable of a retributive strike. Strong (all schools); CL 20th; Weight 5 lb.",

    "description": "Talisman of Reluctant Wishes: A talisman of this sort appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals . Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a talisman of reluctant wishes , he must make a DC 15 Charisma check. If he fails, the device acts as a stone of weight . Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears. If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.) Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.

The bearer of an Orb can dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster ), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb . A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb . Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day. All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs . The owner of an Orb knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb 's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb 's variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level. Black Dragon Orb: Fly (Will DC 17 negates). Blue Dragon Orb: Haste (Fortitude DC 17 negates). Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport (Will DC 19 negates). Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates). Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates). Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs -including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity-but can only use an individual power once per day. She can use dominate on any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates). Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand . Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire . Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half ). White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates).",

The Shadowstaff makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The Shadowstaff also has these powers. Summon Shadows: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level. Summon Nightshade: Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level. Shadow Form: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the gaseous form spell. Shadow Bolt: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet. The Shield of the Sun: This +5 large shield , emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she's already a paladin. The Shield of the Sun also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity. A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.",
